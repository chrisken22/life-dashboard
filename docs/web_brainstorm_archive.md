### Skills Strategy
- Merged into: `PROJECT_PLAN.md → Developer Tooling & Workflow → Skills`
- Summary: Reactive skill creation after code reviews. Flat `.claude/skills/` structure, include rationale not just steps.

### Documentation Strategy
- Merged into: `PROJECT_PLAN.md → Developer Tooling & Workflow → Documentation` + `CLAUDE.md → Documentation Rules`
- Summary: Three primary docs (decision-log, lessons-learned, troubleshooting) created. Rules table and code review cadence added to CLAUDE.md.

### Agents Strategy
- Merged into: `PROJECT_PLAN.md → Developer Tooling & Workflow → Agents`
- Summary: Four planned agents (quick-scaffold, code-reviewer, dashboard-feature, feed-curator), built progressively as patterns emerge.
