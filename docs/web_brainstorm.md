## Ideas & Discussion

### 1. Voice Recognition → Removed (Use Wispr Flow Instead)
- **Decision:** Remove Voice Input from Phase 6. User will use Wispr Flow (external dictation tool) instead of building browser-based speech recognition.
- **Impact:** Remove from Phase 6 features, remove from Decisions Made section.

### 2. Brain Dump: Predefined Prompt Buttons (Phase 1/3)
- **Concept:** Add selectable action buttons to Brain Dump (and any AI input field). Inspired by Wispr Flow snippets.
- **Example prompts:**
  - "Organize thoughts" → "Organize these unstructured thoughts into a clear, polished version without adding, removing, or changing meaning. Improve flow and readability while keeping all original ideas intact."
  - "Extract todos" → Pull actionable items from raw text
  - "Summarize" → Condense to key points
  - Custom user-defined prompts
- **Flow:** Type/talk freely → select what should happen with the input → if nothing selected, AI decides (but maybe better to have staging first)
- **Brain Dump Staging System:**
  - New dumps land in a "review" staging area
  - User categorizes: is it a note? A todo? Something to learn? A task?
  - Over time, user reviews less as AI learns patterns
  - Clear categorization of where each dump goes
- **Phase:** Basic capture in Phase 1, AI categorization + prompt buttons in Phase 3

### 3. Brainstorming Whiteboard (New Feature - Phase 2 or 3?)
- **Concept:** Visual brainstorming space for ideas (business ideas, life ideas, anything)
- **Key insight:** The goal is to START the brain working, not just capture good ideas
- **Categories/tiers:**
  1. **Raw dump** — everything goes here first, no filter
  2. **Good ideas** — promising, worth exploring
  3. **Not-so-good ideas** — keep for reference but lower priority
  4. **Absolutely crazy/impossible ideas** — explicitly encouraged! A stupid idea can spark a good one. List ideas known to be impossible but valuable for brainstorming
- **Philosophy:** Different from normal task capture. This is about creative exploration, not productivity.
- **Could include:** Categorized boards, idea linking, "what if" scenarios

### 4. Vision Board (New Feature - Phase 5 or 6?)
- **Concept:** Visual board for life goals, dreams, aspirations
- **Details:** TBD — needs more discussion on format (images? text? mood boards?)
